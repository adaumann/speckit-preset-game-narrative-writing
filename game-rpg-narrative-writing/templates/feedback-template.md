## Severity Key

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Blocks progression, crashes export, breaks variable state | Fix before next playtest |
| HIGH | Significantly degrades experience (confusion, dominant choice, NPC contradiction) | Fix in current revision cycle |
| MEDIUM | Noticeable but non-blocking | Fix in polish pass |
| LOW | Minor preference — "nice to have" | Address if time allows; not added to tasks.md |

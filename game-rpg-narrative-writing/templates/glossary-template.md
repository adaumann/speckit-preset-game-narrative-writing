# Glossary: [GAME_TITLE]

<!-- Feature: [FEATURE_DIR] | Generated: [GENERATION_DATE] -->
<!-- Consistency reference for all invented terms, proper nouns, variable names, and
     game-specific usage rules. speckit.implement and speckit.checklist check prose
     against this file. speckit.continuity checks world-building consistency.
     Add every term the first time it appears in a node draft. -->

## How to Use This File

- **Before outlining**: scan relevant sections for terms that appear in the node
- **While drafting**: if you invent a new term or use a proper noun, add it here immediately
- **speckit.checklist**: uses Spelling & Capitalization rules to flag inconsistencies (PR-002)
- **speckit.continuity**: uses Definition and Constraints columns to flag contradictions
- **speckit.implement**: uses Variable Name Register to validate hook declarations

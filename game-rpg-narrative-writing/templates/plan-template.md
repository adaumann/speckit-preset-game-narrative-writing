## Game Bible Check

<!-- Gates that MUST pass before node authoring begins.
     Mark each: ? PASS / ?? NEEDS WORK / ? VIOLATION + justification.
     A ? VIOLATION blocks progression unless justified below. -->

<!-- Status values used by speckit.plan:
     ? PASS        � gate satisfied
     ?? NEEDS WORK  � partially satisfied; action required before authoring
     ? VIOLATION   � gate fails; blocks Phase 0 until justified below -->

## World Structure (RPG)

     Spatial model: Linear | Hub-and-Spoke | Open-World -->

**Spatial model**: [Linear / Hub-and-Spoke / Open-World]

| Region | Areas | Locations | Unlock Condition |
|---|---|---|---|

## Act Structure

<!-- Node counts and dramatic purpose per act.
     Convergence nodes are where branches must rejoin before the next act. -->

| Act | Node Count | Key Convergence Node | Narrative Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Act 1 | [N] | NODE-1[NNN] | Setup, inciting incident, first branching decision |
| Act 2 | [N] | NODE-2[NNN] | Rising action, complication, midpoint revelation |
| Act 3 | [N] | � | Climax, diverge to endings |

## Node Graph

<!-- Text representation of the branch graph.
     Use speckit.flowmap to generate the Mermaid diagram.
     Format: NODE-ID: [description] � choice text > NODE-ID | choice text > NODE-ID -->

### Act 1

```
NODE-1001: [OPENING_NODE]
  -> [Choice A] NODE-1002
  -> [Choice B] NODE-1003

NODE-1002: [SETUP_A]
  -> NODE-1004

NODE-1003: [SETUP_B]
  -> NODE-1004

NODE-1004: [CONVERGENCE - ACT 1 END]
  -> NODE-2001
```

### Act 2

```
NODE-2001: [ACT_2_OPEN]
  -> [Choice A] NODE-2002
  -> [Choice B] NODE-2003
  -> [Choice C - requires $inv_key] NODE-2004

NODE-2002: ...
```

### Act 3

```
NODE-3[N]: [CLIMAX]
  -> [Choice A - requires $end_A_progress >= 3] END-A_[Name]
  -> [Choice B] END-B_[Name]
  -> [Choice C] END-C_[Name]

## Information Asymmetry Map

<!-- Which variables gate what information, and which NPCs know what at which point.
     Prevents branching logic that assumes knowledge the player cannot have. -->

| Node ID | Information Revealed | Variable Set | Player Must Not Know Before |
|---|---|---|---|
| NODE-[N] | [INFO] | $flag_[name] | NODE-[N] |
| NODE-[N] | [INFO] | $trust_[npc] >= 50 | � |

## Branch Health Check

<!-- Run speckit.analyze to populate this automatically. Fill manually during planning. -->

| Check | Status | Node IDs |
|---|---|---|
| Dead ends (non-ending nodes with no outgoing choices) | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | |
| Unreachable nodes (no path leads to them) | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | |
| Variables read before set | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | |
| Endings with no reachable path | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | |
| Nodes with only 1 choice (non-terminal) | [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] | |

## Pacing Overview

<!-- tension_score: 1 (calm) to 10 (climax). -->

| Act | Decision Density | Avg Tension | Mechanic Trigger Nodes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Act 1 | low to rising | 3�5 | [N] | Establish world, introduce hooks |
| Act 2 | high | 5�8 | [N] | Complications, NPC state changes |
| Act 3 | very high to resolution | 7�10 | [N] | Endings diverge |

## Node Outline

<!-- Generated by speckit.plan. One entry per node.
     A "node" is a discrete narrative unit the player reaches via navigation or choice.

     Node ID format: NODE-{act}{sequential_3digit}_{ShortName}
       Act 1 nodes  -> NODE-1001_Awakening, NODE-1002_FirstChoice
       Act 2 nodes  -> NODE-2001_Complication, NODE-2003_BetrayalRevealed
       Act 3 nodes  -> NODE-3001_Climax, NODE-3002_FinalGate
       Endings      -> END-A_TrueReconciliation, END-B_Sacrifice, END-C_Escape
     Insertion nodes use letter suffix: NODE-2003b between NODE-2003 and NODE-2004

     Branch types:
       choice    -- presents 2+ choices to the player
       converge  -- merge node, no choice presented
       gate      -- content gated by variable; may branch or converge
       terminal  -- an ending node (use END- prefix) -->

### Node: [NODE_ID] -- [NODE_NAME]
<!-- Example: Node: NODE-1001 -- Opening -->

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Estimated word count** | [range, e.g., 300�600 words] |
| **Act** | [1 / 2 / 3] |
| **Branch type** | [choice / converge / gate / terminal] |
| **Player perspective** | [2nd-person / 3rd-person / uses $pov � omit if not a switching game] |
| **Location** | [location name from world-building.md] |
| **Variables read** | [$var_name (condition)] |
| **Variables written** | [$var_name = value] |
| **NPC presence** | [NPC name -- emotional state] |
| **Status** | outline |

**Opening hook**: [Sensory detail -- not summary. Drop the player into a moment.]

**Key beats** (3�5 micro-events in causal order):
1. [Beat 1 -- causal event]
2. [Beat 2 -- complication or reveal]
3. [Beat 3 -- NPC reaction or world response]
4. [Beat 4 -- optional]
5. [Beat 5 -- optional]

**Choice architecture**:

| Choice text | Condition | Target node | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Choice A text] | [none / $var condition] | NODE-[N] | [$var_name = value] |
| [Choice B text] | [none / $var condition] | NODE-[N] | [$var_name = value] |

**Thematic work**: [How theme is carried in this node without being stated explicitly.]

**Closing beat**: [What has irreversibly changed. What the player now knows or suspects.]

<!-- Required beat flag (if applicable): [REQUIRED: fulfills KEY-SCENE-N] -->

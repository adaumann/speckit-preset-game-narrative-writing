# speckit.foreshadow

Foreshadowing & payoff tracker — verify that all **payoffs have prior setups** and all **mysteries feel fair** rather than random or cheap. Ensures player has enough information to solve puzzles or predict twists before they happen.

## Foreshadowing Principle

**Fair mystery** = Clues are placed before revelation; player could theoretically solve mystery if attentive.  
**Cheap twist** = Revelation appears random because clues were absent or placed too late.

**Valid foreshadowing includes**:
- ✅ Explicit clue ("The vase has a hairline crack")
- ✅ Implicit hint ("Why does Marcus always leave at sunset?")
- ✅ Symbolic foreshadowing (red herring used for flavor; real clue elsewhere)
- ✅ Character behavior (NPC avoids certain topics, suggesting secrets)

**Invalid foreshadowing includes**:
- ❌ Orphaned foreshadowing (clue placed but never paid off; confusion)
- ❌ Premature payoff (revelation before clue is placed; unfair)
- ❌ Inaccessible clue (locked behind missed branch; unsolvable)
- ❌ Contradiction (clue conflicts with later revelation; feels arbitrary)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Accepted input:
- Nothing — audit entire game for clue-payoff pairs
- Mystery ID (e.g., `MYS-001`) — audit one mystery only
- `--branch [BRANCH_ID]` — audit clues in one story branch only
- `--clue-only` — show only placement issues (ignore payoff timing)

Optional flags:
- `--strict` — flag any clue not placed before payoff (even if obvious)
- `--show-paths` — display clue → payoff chain for each mystery
- `--check-accessibility` — verify clues reachable in all branches

## Pre-Execution Checks

1. Load `specs/foreshadow-template.md` or extract from spec.md (mysteries, plot twists)
2. Confirm `specs/plan.md` exists with node sequence
3. Load all `draft/[ENGINE]/NODE-*.md` files to locate clue text and payoff moments
4. Parse for clue keywords (names, objects, behaviors)
5. Identify payoff moments (reveals, twists, puzzle solutions)

## Execution Steps

### 1. **Define Mysteries & Payoffs**

Extract from spec.md or foreshadow template:

**Example mysteries**:
```
MYS-001: Who is Marcus really?
  Genre: Betrayal twist
  Setup: NODE-005 (Marcus introduced as ally)
  Clues:
    • NODE-010: Marcus asks suspicious questions
    • NODE-015: Marcus is never present at night
    • NODE-020: Marcus carries a militia ring
  Payoff: NODE-025 (Revealed: Marcus is undercover militia spy)

MYS-002: What happened to Sera?
  Genre: Loss/mystery
  Setup: NODE-007 (Sera disappears between scenes)
  Clues:
    • NODE-012: Found Sera's locket near the docks
    • NODE-017: Heard rumors of kidnapping
    • NODE-022: Marcus hints he knows something
  Payoff: NODE-025 (Revealed: Sera was taken by militia to pressure you)

MYS-003: Where is the hidden treasure?
  Genre: Puzzle
  Setup: NODE-003 (Old map discovered)
  Clues:
    • NODE-008: "X marks the spot" — painting in tavern
    • NODE-014: Innkeeper mentions cellar lock
    • NODE-019: "Three paces north" — carved on bench
  Payoff: NODE-023 (Treasure found in cellar: 3 paces north from painting)
```

### 2. **Map Clue Placement vs. Payoff**

For each mystery, create a timeline:

```
MYS-001: Who is Marcus really?

Clue: "Marcus asks about your supply routes"
  Placed in: NODE-010 (page 15)
  Payoff: NODE-025 (page 40)
  Gap: 10 nodes / ~25 pages
  ✅ SUFFICIENT: Player has 25 pages to notice pattern

Clue: "Marcus carries militia insignia ring"
  Placed in: NODE-020 (page 35)
  Payoff: NODE-025 (page 40)
  Gap: 1 node / 5 pages
  ✅ DIRECT: Last-minute clue before payoff (reinforces theory)

Clue: "Marcus is never present at night"
  Placed in: NODE-015 (page 25)
  Payoff: NODE-025 (page 40)
  Gap: 10 nodes / 15 pages
  ✅ SUFFICIENT: Clear pattern before payoff

Analysis:
  Clue placement: ✅ All clues before payoff
  Distribution: ✅ Spread across 15 pages (not all at end)
  Sufficiency: ✅ Player has ample time to notice
  Fairness: ✅ Attentive player could solve before NODE-025
  Status: ✅ FAIR MYSTERY
```

### 3. **Detect Foreshadowing Violations**

#### 🔴 **VIOLATION: Premature Payoff**
Revelation happens before clue is placed.

```
MYS-002: What happened to Sera?

Payoff (revelation): NODE-022
  "Sera was kidnapped by militia"
  
Clues (placed after):
  • Locket found: NODE-024 (2 nodes AFTER reveal!)
  • Militia mention: NODE-025
  • Marcus hint: NODE-026
  
Problem: Player learns Sera was kidnapped at NODE-022,
         but proof appears in NODE-024, NODE-025, NODE-026
         This feels backward—reveals before evidence
         
Status: ❌ UNFAIR MYSTERY
Fix: Either:
  1. Move clues to NODE-015—NODE-021 (before reveal)
  2. Change payoff node to NODE-026 (after all clues)
  3. Add immediate clue at NODE-022 to justify the reveal
```

**Report**:
```
MYS-002: Premature Payoff
  Revelation: NODE-022
  First supporting clue: NODE-024 (2 nodes AFTER)
  
  Status: ❌ UNFAIR
  Impact: Player can't predict this reveal
  Fix: Reorganize clues to precede payoff by at least 3 nodes
```

#### 🟡 **VIOLATION: Orphaned Foreshadowing**
Clue placed but never paid off; confuses player.

```
MYS-003: Where is the hidden treasure?

Clue: "The innkeeper mentions a cellar lock"
  Placed in: NODE-014
  Payoff: NONE (treasure is found in attic, not cellar)
  
Problem: Player hears about cellar lock but it's irrelevant
         Feels like abandoned plot thread
         Confuses intended mystery solving
         
Status: ⚠️  ORPHANED CLUE
Options:
  1. Move treasure to cellar (pay off the clue)
  2. Remove cellar mention (don't introduce fake clue)
  3. Explain cellar lock later (reveal it was red herring intentionally)
```

**Report**:
```
MYS-003: Orphaned Foreshadowing
  Clue: "Innkeeper mentions cellar lock"
  Placed: NODE-014
  Payoff: NONE
  
  Status: ⚠️  ORPHANED
  Impact: Confusing to player; feels like plot hole
  Fix: Either pay off (move treasure to cellar) or remove (edit NODE-014)
```

#### 🟠 **VIOLATION: Inaccessible Clue**
Clue locked behind branch player might not visit; payoff unsolvable.

```
MYS-004: Who killed the mayor?

Clue: "Weapon found in Marcus's room"
  Placed in: NODE-015 (BRANCH A only)
  
Branch B (alternative path):
  NODE-015: Takes different route (never visits Marcus's room)
  NODE-025: Payoff — "Marcus killed the mayor"
  
Problem: Branch B players never see evidence
         Mystery feels unsolvable in Branch B
         Same payoff without clue = unfair mystery
         
Status: ⚠️  INACCESSIBLE CLUE
Fix: Either:
  1. Add alternate clue in Branch B (different evidence)
  2. Move main clue to common node before branch (NODE-010)
  3. Only pay off mystery in Branch A (B players don't learn truth)
```

**Report**:
```
MYS-004: Inaccessible Clue in Branch B
  Clue: "Weapon in Marcus's room"
  Placed: NODE-015 (Branch A only)
  Payoff: NODE-025 (both branches)
  
  Status: ⚠️  UNFAIR IN BRANCH B
  Impact: Mystery feels random in Branch B
  Fix: Add alternate clue reachable in Branch B before NODE-025
```

#### 🔵 **VIOLATION: Contradicting Clue**
Multiple clues point to different conclusions.

```
MYS-005: Is Marcus trustworthy?

Clue 1: "Marcus volunteers to help without payment"
        Interpretation: Trustworthy (aligned with your cause)
        Placed: NODE-010

Clue 2: "Marcus asks detailed questions about your network"
        Interpretation: Spy (suspicious interest)
        Placed: NODE-015

Payoff: NODE-025
  "Marcus was gathering intelligence for militia"
  
Analysis: 
  Clue 1 suggests innocence, Clue 2 suggests guilt
  Without additional context, player can't determine which is true
  Feels like contradiction rather than misdirection
  
Status: ⚠️  AMBIGUOUS
  If intentional misdirection: ✅ OK (red herring)
  If unintentional contradiction: ❌ Unfair
  
Question: Is the voluntary help meant to mask ulterior motives?
         Should be explicit if so.
```

**Report**:
```
MYS-005: Contradicting Clues (Review Needed)
  Clue 1 interpretation: Trustworthy
  Clue 2 interpretation: Suspicious
  
  Status: ⚠️  AMBIGUOUS
  Verdict: Is this intentional misdirection or accident?
  Recommendation: Add clarifying beat showing Marcus's true motivation
                 (e.g., his "kindness" is calculated strategy)
```

#### ✅ **VALID: Fair Mystery**
Clues placed strategically; payoff feels earned.

```
MYS-001: Who is Marcus really?

Timeline:
  NODE-010: Clue 1 (Marcus asks suspicious questions)
  NODE-015: Clue 2 (Marcus absent at night)
  NODE-020: Clue 3 (Militia ring)
  NODE-025: Payoff (Marcus is spy)
  
Clue distribution: Spread across 15 pages
Clue quantity: 3 clues (sufficient for player awareness)
Clue clarity: Each clue independently points toward "spy" interpretation
Payoff timing: 5 pages after last clue (reinforcement before reveal)
Player prediction: Attentive reader could predict "Marcus is spy" at NODE-015 or NODE-020

Status: ✅ FAIR MYSTERY
Quality: Excellent (enough clues, good distribution, satisfying payoff)
```

### 4. **Generate Foreshadowing Audit Report**

Create `specs/foreshadow-audit.md`:

```markdown
## Foreshadowing & Payoff Audit

**Game**: [NAME]
**Date**: [ISO]

### Mystery Fairness Table

| Mystery ID | Name | Clue Count | Placement | Distribution | Payoff | Status |
|------------|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| MYS-001 | Marcus spy? | 3 | Early | Spread | Fair | ✅ PASS |
| MYS-002 | Sera fate? | 2 | Late | Clustered | Unfair | ⚠️ REVIEW |
| MYS-003 | Treasure loc? | 3 | Optimal | Well-spaced | Fair | ✅ PASS |
| MYS-004 | Mayor killer? | 1 | Branch-only | Inaccessible | Unfair | ⚠️ FIX |

### Violations

**🔴 Premature Payoffs** (1):
- MYS-002 (Sera): Reveals at NODE-022; clues appear NODE-024+
  Fix: Move clues to NODE-015—NODE-021

**🟡 Orphaned Clues** (1):
- MYS-003: Cellar lock mentioned but treasure in attic
  Fix: Move treasure to cellar OR remove cellar reference

**🟠 Inaccessible Clues** (1):
- MYS-004: Branch B can't access weapon clue
  Fix: Add alternate clue in Branch B

**🔵 Contradicting Clues** (0):
- None found

### Fair Mysteries

**✅ PASS** (2):
- MYS-001: Well-distributed clues; fair payoff
- MYS-003: Good pacing; solvable with attention

### Recommendations

**Priority 1 (Fix before release)**:
1. MYS-002: Reorganize clue timing relative to payoff
2. MYS-004: Add Branch B alternate clue

**Priority 2 (Polish)**:
1. MYS-003: Add one more cellar reference to strengthen foreshadowing OR move treasure
```

### 5. **Show Paths** (optional with --show-paths)

Display full clue chain for each mystery:

```
MYS-001: Who is Marcus really?

Clue Chain:
  NODE-010 → "Marcus asks about supply routes"
    └─ Suggests: He's gathering intelligence
  
  NODE-015 → "Marcus disappears at night"
    └─ Suggests: Secret activity
    └─ Combined with previous: Intelligence gathering
  
  NODE-020 → "Marcus carries militia insignia"
    └─ Suggests: Military connection
    └─ Combined: Marcus is military agent
  
  NODE-025 → PAYOFF: "Marcus is militia spy"
    └─ Confirmed by all three clues
    └─ Player could have deduced this at NODE-020

Player prediction timeline:
  NODE-010: "Something's odd about Marcus" (1 clue, weak signal)
  NODE-015: "Marcus is definitely hiding something" (2 clues, pattern emerges)
  NODE-020: "Marcus is a military agent" (3 clues, solution obvious)
  NODE-025: Payoff (confirmation)
```

### 6. **Accessibility Check** (optional with --check-accessibility)

Verify clues are reachable in all branches:

```
MYS-001: Marcus spy?

Branch A path:
  NODE-005 (common)
  NODE-010 ✅ Clue 1 found
  NODE-015 ✅ Clue 2 found
  NODE-020 ✅ Clue 3 found
  NODE-025 ✅ Payoff
  Status: ✅ All clues accessible

Branch B path:
  NODE-005 (common)
  NODE-007 (diverges)
  NODE-015 ⚠️ Different path, doesn't visit NODE-010/NODE-015
  NODE-022 (reconverges)
  NODE-025 ✅ Payoff
  
  Problem: Branch B misses Clues 1 & 2
  Solution: Add alternate clues in Branch B path (NODE-007, NODE-014)
```

### 7. **Report**

Output `foreshadow-audit.md` with:
- Mystery fairness table (clue count, placement, distribution)
- Violation list (premature, orphaned, inaccessible, contradicting)
- Specific recommendations per mystery
- If `--show-paths`: Full clue chain for each mystery
- If `--check-accessibility`: Branch-by-branch accessibility analysis

## Important Notes

**Clue Quantity**: 2–3 well-placed clues is ideal for subtle mysteries. 4+ clues risks being heavy-handed. 1 clue risks being missable.

**Clue Distribution**: Spread clues across ~10+ nodes / pages before payoff. Clustering all clues right before payoff feels like info-dump (unfair surprise).

**Accessibility Across Branches**: If same mystery pays off in multiple branches, ensure clues are accessible in all branches (or provide branch-specific alternate clues).

**Red Herrings Are OK**: Intentional false clues add depth. Mark them in foreshadow template so you don't confuse them with actual clues. (e.g., "Clue 2B [RED HERRING]: Marcus's midnight disappearances are explained later as insomnia, not spying.")

**Player Attention**: Assume moderate player attention. Don't expect players to notice subtle clues, but do expect them to catch direct statements and obvious behavioral patterns.

**Mystery Genre Matters**: Whodunits need more clues; character-driven games need fewer. Adjust clue density based on game genre and player expectations.

description: Research tracking command for game narrative. Four modes — add (log a new research item or source finding), resolve (mark an item answered and capture the finding), check (scan drafted nodes for claims not backed by research.md), and status (research dashboard showing open items ranked by project risk). Drives task generation in speckit.tasks. Run any time from first concept through export.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

Accepted arguments:
- *(no argument)* — display the research status dashboard (same as `status`)
- `add [topic]` — open an interactive session to log a new research item (e.g. `add Cold War submarine hierarchy`)
- `add [topic] --source "[source]"` — log a finding directly with a source (skips interactive prompts)
- `resolve [R-ID]` — mark a research item resolved and capture findings (e.g. `resolve R003`)
- `resolve [R-ID] --finding "[text]" --source "[source]"` — resolve inline
- `check` — scan all drafted nodes for factual or world-rule claims not backed by any research item (read-only)
- `check [NODE_ID]` — scope the check to a specific node
- `status` — display the research dashboard
- `status --open` — show only OPEN items
- `status --resolved` — show only RESOLVED items

---

## Purpose

`speckit.research` keeps the factual and world-building grounding of a game narrative explicit, traceable, and integrated with the drafting workflow. It manages `research.md` as a living document that:

1. Records every domain knowledge gap before it becomes a prose or consistency error
2. Captures source findings and maps them to specific nodes and branches
3. Drives research task generation in `speckit.tasks` (tasks are generated from R-items, not static placeholders)
4. Scans drafted nodes for unsupported factual or world-rule claims after writing begins

**Research scope for game narrative** includes:
- **World/setting accuracy**: historical, technical, cultural, geographic details the game world draws on
- **Reference games**: comparable IF titles, engine-specific conventions, genre expectations
- **Mechanic design**: how similar mechanics are implemented in reference games; player psychology research
- **NPC authenticity**: professional roles, speech registers, social dynamics that need grounding

**Scope of this command**:
- Only reads/writes `research.md` and (in `check` mode) reads node files.
- Does not revise prose — use `speckit.revise` to fix nodes where findings require changes.
- `check` is strictly read-only.

---

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_research` key.
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

**Search index** (large projects — optional):

## Step 1 — Setup and Mode Resolution

Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse `FEATURE_DIR`.

Locate `FEATURE_DIR/research.md`. If the file does not exist:
- For `add` mode: create it from `templates/research-template.md`. Populate `## Research Scope` from `specs/spec.md` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if present (setting, technical domains, reference games, cultural context). Emit: `? Created research.md from template. Proceeding to add first item.`
- For `resolve`, `check`, or `status` modes: abort with `? research.md not found. Run speckit.research add [topic] to create it.`

- `add …` ? **Mode: Add**
- `resolve …` ? **Mode: Resolve**
- `check …` ? **Mode: Check**
- `status …` or *(empty)* ? **Mode: Status**

---

## Mode: Add

**Purpose**: Log a new research item — a knowledge gap that needs answering before or during drafting.

### Add Step 1 — Parse topic

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a topic after `add`: use it as the item title. Otherwise prompt:
> `What topic needs research? (e.g. "Cold War submarine officer hierarchy", "symptoms of radiation exposure", "how Ink handles nested conditions")`

### Add Step 2 — Context questions


1. **Why does this matter?**
   > `Which node, branch, or mechanic requires this knowledge? (e.g. "NODE-2003 — player must give correct orders in the control room")`

2. **Specific questions to answer** (ask for up to 3):
   > `What specific factual questions need answers? Enter each on a new line:`
   Accept free-form text. Each non-empty line becomes one bullet in the `Questions to answer` list.

3. **Authenticity risk** — is this an expert-visible error?
   > `Would a specialist player or reader catch it if this is wrong? (y/n)`

4. **Node impact** (if a node was named in question 1):
   > `How will the findings change the prose, dialogue, choices, or mechanic logic? (leave blank if unknown)`

5. **Existing source** (if `--source` was passed, skip this):
   > `Do you have a source already? If yes, paste or describe it. (leave blank to skip)`
   If a source is provided with a finding: jump to **Add Step 4** (resolve immediately).

### Add Step 3 — Write the item

Auto-assign the next `R-NNN` ID (highest existing ID + 1, starting at `R001` if none exist).

Append the new item to `research.md ## Research Items`:

```markdown
### R[NNN] — [Topic Name]
**Why this matters**: [node/branch reference + explanation]
**Questions to answer**:
- [question 1]
- [question 2]
**Findings**: OPEN
**Sources**: —
**Node impact**: [text or TBD]
```


```markdown
| [FLAG description] | [NODE_ID or branch] | [Risk if Wrong] |
```

Confirm:
```
? Added: R[NNN] — [Topic Name]   Status: OPEN
  Authenticity flag: [Yes / No]
  Next step: run `speckit.research resolve R[NNN]` when you have findings.
             Or: add it to tasks.md as a research task via `speckit.tasks`.
```

### Add Step 4 — Immediate resolve (if source was provided)

If a source AND finding were provided in Add Step 2: call **Mode: Resolve** for this item inline. Do not prompt again.

---

## Mode: Resolve

**Purpose**: Mark a research item answered and record the finding.

### Resolve Step 1 — Locate item

Parse `R-ID` from `$ARGUMENTS`. Find the matching `### R[NNN]` block in `research.md`. If not found, abort:
```
? R[NNN] not found in research.md.
  Run `speckit.research status` to see all item IDs.
```

If the item already has `Status: RESOLVED`, warn and ask: `R[NNN] is already resolved. Update the finding? (y/n)`

### Resolve Step 2 — Gather findings

If `--finding` and `--source` were passed in `$ARGUMENTS`: use them directly.

Otherwise prompt:

1. > `What did you find? (paste or summarise your research finding)`
2. > `Source? (book title + page, URL, expert source, reference game, etc.)`
3. > `Does this change anything in specs/plan.md, the spec, or drafted nodes?`
   - If yes: prompt for a brief note. Append it to the finding block as `**Flowmap impact**: [note]` — this is not automatically applied; it is a flag for the author to act on.

### Resolve Step 3 — Update research.md

In the `### R[NNN]` block:
- Replace `**Findings**: OPEN` with `**Findings**: [finding text]`
- Replace `**Sources**: —` with `**Sources**: [source text]`
- Add or update `**Flowmap impact**: [note]` if applicable

Move the block from `## Research Items` to `## Resolved Research` table:

| R[NNN] | [Topic] | [one-sentence finding summary] | [source] |


Confirm:
```
? Resolved: R[NNN] — [Topic Name]
  Finding logged. Source: [source summary]
  [Plan impact: (note) — review specs/plan.md and consider running speckit.continuity if nodes are drafted]
  Remaining OPEN items: [N]
```

---

## Mode: Check

**Purpose**: Scan drafted nodes for specific, verifiable factual or world-rule claims that are not backed by a resolved R-item in `research.md`. Read-only.

### Check Step 1 — Load assets

Load `research.md`. Build two lists:
- **RESOLVED claims**: collect all findings from the `## Resolved Research` table. For each, extract: topic, node reference, key factual assertions from the finding text.
- **OPEN items**: collect all `R-NNN` blocks with `Findings: OPEN`. Note their node references.

Determine the node scope:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a NODE_ID: load only that node file from `nodes/`.
- Otherwise: scan all `nodes/*.md` files.

If no node files exist, abort: `? No node files found in nodes/. Run speckit.implement to generate drafts first.`

### Check Step 2 — Scan for unsupported claims

For each node in scope, identify **specific factual or world-rule claims** — statements that assert:
- A real-world historical, technical, cultural, or geographic detail
- A professional role, procedure, or institution that requires domain knowledge
- A world rule stated as fact that should be backed by explicit design decision in `specs/world-building.md` or `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- A reference game mechanic or IF convention stated as normative

For each detected claim:

1. Check whether a RESOLVED R-item covers it (topic match, node reference match, or finding text directly addresses the claim).
   - **Covered** ? no flag
2. Check whether an OPEN R-item references the same node or topic.
   - **Open research pending** ? flag as `PENDING`
3. No R-item covers it ? flag as `UNSUPPORTED`

### Check Step 3 — Output report

```

  Scope  : [NODE_ID or "all drafted nodes"]
  Nodes checked : [N]
  Date   : [YYYY-MM-DD]

| Node | Claim | Linked R-item |
|---|---|---|
| NODE-1004 | "The 1991 coup was announced by radio first" | R004 — Soviet coup announcement sequence |

### COVERED (mention in brief)
N claims checked against resolved research — no issues found.

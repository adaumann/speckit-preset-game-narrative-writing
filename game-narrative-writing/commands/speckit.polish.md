## Polish Purpose: "Making Prose Invisible"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Polish is the final pass that removes friction between player and story. It operates at the sentence and paragraph level — not the node level. A node that passes `speckit.verify` is structurally sound; polish makes it feel effortless and immersive.

**NOT for structural problems** — use `speckit.revise`:
- ❌ NOT "This node doesn't gate properly on the variable"
- ❌ NOT "The ending choice isn't reachable"
- ❌ NOT "This NPC doesn't match their character profile"

**NOT for continuity/dialogue tree issues** — use `speckit.continuity`:
- ❌ NOT "Dialogue register doesn't match NPC's trust state" (checked by continuity)
- ❌ NOT "Glossary term spelled inconsistently" (checked by continuity)
- ❌ NOT "Location description contradicts earlier node" (checked by continuity)
- ❌ NOT "Dialogue tree structure is poorly organized" (checklist/outline territory)

**FOR prose surface quality**:
- ✅ Sentence rhythm variation (short/long alternation, end-weight)
- ✅ Word repetition within paragraphs and across adjacent paragraphs
- ✅ Filter word removal (`she noticed`, `he felt`, `she saw`, `he heard`)
- ✅ Adverb density reduction (max 1 adverb per 200 words of prose)
- ✅ Weak verb replacement (`was`, `had`, `got`) with active/precise verbs
- ✅ Voice register drift (NPC or narrator vocabulary register slipping)
- ✅ Em-dash and ellipsis overuse
- ✅ Paragraph opening word variety (no two consecutive paragraphs starting with the same word)
- ✅ Dialogue attribution quality (said-bookism, adverb-on-attribution)

**Metaphor**: If `speckit.verify` is the unit test suite, polish is the linter and formatter — it catches surface patterns that tests don't see.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
Expected format: a node ID (e.g., `NODE-005`) or a range (e.g., `NODE-005—NODE-008`). If empty, polish the most recently drafted node with a PASS verify verdict.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before polishing)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_polish` key
- Process as standard hook block (Optional/Mandatory). Skip silently if absent.

## Operating Constraints

**VOICE AUTHORITY**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is the final arbiter of what is correct prose. Polish must not "improve" a sentence into a voice that doesn't belong to the NPC or narrator. A low-register NPC must remain low-register even after polishing. Narrative tone (from **Tone** in §VII) governs emotional temperature — do not neutralize a node's intended dark humour, bleakness, or urgency while fixing rhythm.

**CHECKLIST GATE**: Do not polish a node whose most recent checklist verdict is FAIL. Emit an error and direct the user to run `speckit.revise` first.

**SCOPE**: Only the node prose is touched. YAML frontmatter (other than `version`, `actual_words`, and adding `polished:` field) is not altered. Choice and mechanic hook syntax is never altered.

**PROHIBITION**: Do not change the meaning or structural function of any sentence. If a fix requires changing what a sentence communicates, stop and flag it — do not silently rewrite.

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse `FEATURE_DIR`.

2. **Identify the target**:
   - Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for node ID or range. Resolve to `specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/draft/[ENGINE]/[NODE_ID].[EXT]` file(s) (auto-detect engine from first matching file).
   - If no argument given: find the most recently modified draft node file whose matching checklist has `Verdict: PASS`.
   - For each target file, verify the most recent checklist in `checklists/` has `Verdict: PASS`. If FAIL: abort that file with: `✗ <NODE_ID>: checklist is FAIL — run speckit.revise before polishing.`
   - Skip any file that has `revised: [date]` in frontmatter but no `polished: [date]` since revisions invalidate prior polish (user must confirm to re-polish after revisions)

3. **Load context**:
   - Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`: style mode, story-specific Anti-AI phrases (§VII), em-dash cap rule, **Language** (§VII Language), **Tone** (§VII Tone), **Target Audience** (§VII Target Audience), **Tense** (§VII Tense), **Sentence Rhythm** (§VII Sentence Rhythm). Tone governs emotional temperature and irony during polish — do not neutralize a node's intended dark humour, bleakness, or urgency while fixing rhythm. Target Audience governs vocabulary ceiling — do not replace simple diction with elevated synonyms when audience is middle-grade or young-adult. Tense governs the required narrative tense; flag any tense drift found during polish as a separate WARNING rather than silently correcting it. Sentence Rhythm provides the story-specific baseline for the rhythm checks (PR-001, PR-002) — apply the author's stated pattern, not a generic alternation rule.
   - Read `.specify/memory/craft-rules.md`: universal Anti-AI Filter phrases, active prose profile rules, voice register standards
   - Identify NPCs appearing in this node from the YAML frontmatter `npcs:` field. For each NPC, read `specs/characters/[NPC_ID].md`: vocabulary pool, vocabulary register, verbal tics, speech-under-stress patterns, emotional response patterns
   - Parse the node frontmatter to identify the **narrative register** (if the node has non-choice narration). Apply vocabulary rules to narration prose separately from NPC dialogue.

   **Language-aware scope**: If `Language ≠ en` (or Language is not set to `en`), the following checks are **English-only and must be SKIPPED**:
   - WR-001 Filter word list (`she noticed`, `he felt`, etc.) — these patterns are English-specific; do not apply to other languages
   - WR-004 Adverb density (the `-ly` suffix rule is English-specific morphology)
   - DI-001 Said-bookism (dialogue attribution norms vary strongly by language)
   - DI-002 Adverb on attribution (same reason)
   For `Language ≠ en`, the following checks are **language-agnostic and always active**: PR-001—PR-004 (rhythm), WR-002 (word repetition), WR-003 (weak verbs), WR-005 (throat-clearing), VR-001—VR-006, DI-003 (double punctuation).
   Notify the user at the start of the audit: `ℹ️ Language is set to [LANGUAGE] — English-specific checks (WR-001, WR-004, DI-001, DI-002) are disabled.`
   - Read `glossary.md` if present: Section V (Usage Rules) — capitalization rules, spelling preferences, terms that must not appear, and terms with restricted meaning. These supplement the Anti-AI Filter for this specific node's context.
   - Read author voice sample (if `STYLE_MODE: author-sample`): use it as the rhythm reference for sentence length calibration

4. **Run the polish audit** — scan the node prose for each issue category and record every instance:

   **PR — Prose Rhythm**
   - PR-001: Sentence length monotony — 4+ consecutive sentences within ±20% of the same word count
   - PR-002: End-weight violation — sentence ends on a weak/unstressed syllable cluster in a high-tension node or during an emotional peak
   - PR-003: Paragraph opening repetition — two or more consecutive paragraphs opening with the same word or construction
   - PR-004: Paragraph length monotony — 4+ consecutive paragraphs of the same approximate length

   **WR — Word-Level Issues**
   - WR-001: Filter word — `she noticed`, `he saw`, `she heard`, `he felt`, `she realized`, `he thought`, `she wondered`, `he knew`, `she looked`, `he watched` (and variants)
   - WR-002: Same content word repeated within 100 words (excluding NPC names, pronouns, conjunctions, and mechanical terms like choice labels)
   - WR-003: Weak verb — `was [adjective]`, `had [noun]`, `got [adjective/past participle]` in a position where a precise verb is available
   - WR-004: Adverb count exceeds 1 per 200 words in any 400-word window
   - WR-005: Throat-clearing opener — sentence or paragraph opening that delays the real content (`It was at this point that...`, `She found herself thinking about...`)

   **VR — Voice Register**
   - VR-001: Vocabulary above the NPC's register (word not in their vocabulary pool; check `specs/characters/[NPC_ID].md` Section III Vocabulary Pool). For narrative prose, check against the Prose Style Mode register in constitution.md.
   - VR-002: Vocabulary below register in a passage requiring precision or authority
   - VR-003: Verbal tic absent from an NPC's dialogue where the character is under stress (tic should be present per `specs/characters/[NPC_ID].md` Section VI Speech-Under-Stress)
   - VR-004: Em-dash count exceeds constitution.md limit per page-equivalent (every 250 words)
   - VR-005: Ellipsis used to pad or suggest vagueness rather than trailing thought or interrupted speech
   - VR-006: Glossary violation — a term from `glossary.md` is misspelled, incorrectly capitalised, used in a rejected variant form, or used with a meaning that contradicts its story-specific definition (only checked if `glossary.md` is present)

   **DI — Dialogue Internals** (dialogue-line level only; node-level dialogue strategy is `speckit.verify` territory)
   - DI-001: Said-bookism — dialogue attribution using a verb other than `said`/`asked` and their tense forms, where the action is not physically distinct. Exception: game-specific attribution is permitted if it conveys a mechanic (e.g. `threatened` to signal a trust shift, provided it appears in character profile register)
   - DI-002: Adverb on attribution (`said quietly`, `asked nervously`) — remove or show via action beat instead
   - DI-003: Double punctuation with attribution (`"Oh." she said.` → `"Oh," she said.`)

5. **Present the Polish Audit Report** before making any edits:

   ```
   ## Polish Audit: <NODE_ID>

   | Issue ID | Category | Location | Issue | Proposed fix |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | PR-001 | Rhythm | Para 3, sentences 2–6 | 5 sentences averaging 12 words | Vary: split sentence 4; merge 5+6 |
   | WR-001 | Filter word | Para 7, line 2 | "She noticed the door was ajar" | "The door stood ajar." |
   | WR-002 | Repetition | Paras 11–12 | "dark" × 3 in 80 words | Replace 2nd instance; remove 3rd |
   | VR-001 | Register | Para 9, line 4 | "ameliorate" — above Corvus's register | Replace with "fix" or "ease" |
   | DI-002 | Dialogue | Line 24 | "asked nervously" | Show via action beat or remove adverb |

   NPCs present: Corvus (2 dialogue lines), Marcus (1 dialogue line)
   Total issues: N (PR: N | WR: N | VR: N | DI: N)
   Estimated change surface: N sentences / N words affected
   ```

   **Stop and wait for user confirmation** before applying any edits. Allow the user to:
   - Approve all fixes
   - Skip specific items (`skip WR-002 in para 11 — repetition is intentional`)
   - Provide a direction note for an item
   - Approve by category (`apply all WR fixes, skip PR fixes`)

6. **Apply approved fixes** in top-to-bottom order:
   - Make only the changes in the confirmed scope
   - Do not cascade edits beyond the fix (if shortening a sentence changes a nearby rhythm issue that wasn't in scope, leave it — flag it for the next pass)
   - After each fix, verify: the sentence still communicates the same thing; the voice register is still correct (NPC or narrative); no new repetition has been introduced in the immediate vicinity
   - **Preserve engine syntax**: For engine-specific targets (Ink, SugarCube, Ren'Py, etc.), ensure polish edits do not alter:
     - Choice syntax (`* [Label]` in Ink, `[[Label→Target]]` in SugarCube, `menu:` in Ren'Py)
     - Mechanic hook syntax (`[MECHANIC:TYPE]` blocks, variable declarations)
     - Engine-specific keywords or function calls
     - Only the prose *content* is polished; code structure is untouched

7. **Assemble the polished draft**:
   - Write the full node with all approved fixes applied
   - Update YAML frontmatter:
     - Increment `version` (e.g., `version: 2` → `version: 3`)
     - Update `actual_words` with new word count
     - Add `polished: [YYYY-MM-DD]` field (insert after `revised:` if present, else after `drafted:`)
   - Save as `specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/draft/[ENGINE]/[NODE_ID]_v<N>.[EXT]` (e.g., `specs/[FEATURE_DIR]/draft/ink/NODE-005_v3.ink`)
   - Keep all prior versions unchanged

8. **Append polish notes** to the top of the polished file (after YAML frontmatter, before prose):
   ```
   <!-- POLISH NOTES v<N>
        Polished: [YYYY-MM-DD]
        Issues fixed: N (PR: N | WR: N | VR: N | DI: N)
        Issues skipped: [list with reason]
        Net word delta: [+N / -N words]
   -->
   ```

9. **Report**:
   - Path to polished node file
   - Issues fixed vs. skipped
   - Net word delta
   - Any items flagged during fixing that require meaning-change review (user must decide)
   - Recommendation: "Run `speckit.continuity --check dialogue,glossary,locations` to validate cross-node consistency before export. Run `speckit.compile` to test engine compilation."
   - If no issues were found: `✅ <NODE_ID>: prose is clean — no polish changes needed.`

10. **Check for extension hooks** (after polishing): check `hooks.after_polish` in `.specify/extensions.yml`. Process as standard hook block. Skip silently if absent.

11. **Update search index** (optional — large projects):
    - Polished node files are re-indexed incrementally so continuity and research checks query the final prose.
    - If the command fails or the index does not exist, skip silently.

## Important Notes

**Polish vs. Revision Lifecycle**:
- If a node is `polished: [date]` and then revised with `speckit.revise`, the `polished:` field is **removed** during revision
- After revisions are complete and checklist passes again, run `speckit.polish` again to re-polish the revised prose
- This ensures polish stage always reflects the current state of the prose

**Polish does NOT address**:
- Dialogue tree structure or multi-party dialogue consistency → use `speckit.continuity --check dialogue`
- Glossary term usage or capitalization consistency → use `speckit.continuity --check glossary`
- Location description consistency across nodes → use `speckit.continuity --check locations`
- Said-bookism that conveys a mechanic (e.g., `threatened` as trust signal in character profile) → skip DI-001 for those cases
- Branch structure or choice logic → use `speckit.revise` or `speckit.analyze`
